# weather

This is a final project from a Web Design III class that uses the Laravel Framework.

This website gets data from my personal weather station and displays easy to read charts. Some features are locked behind a login so a user must login to use those. There is also a forum for users to post messages to.

The controllers that do most of the processing are inside "app>Http>Controllers"<br>
	Especially "PagesController" and the "PostsController"
	
The data files are in the "data" folder

The views that use php for displaying the front end are found in "resources>views"</p>
